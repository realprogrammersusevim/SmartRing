This iOS application is designed to connect to a ColmiR02 smart ring, retrieve
health data, and store it. It allows users to track health metrics collected by
the smart ring and store them in Apple Health.

## Installation

You'll need Xcode to run this and install it on your iPhone.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/realprogrammersusevim/Vilya
open Vilya -a Xcode
```

## Usage example

Screen recording of connecting to the ring, getting the battery and then getting my current heart rate and blood oxygen. Everything is logged to Apple Health in the background.
